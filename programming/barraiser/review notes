Overall Feedback for all categories
  Design and Architecture
    API designing
      - Candidate was able to provide a basic desciption of for both feed fetch API and post create API
      - Candidate missed critical details of pagination and error codes in feed fetch API
      - Candidate gave wrong response status code for post create API
    Solutioning of problem
      - The overall solution architecture provided by the candidate worked on brute force application design Principles
      - The solution sufferred from critical performance issues that would render it useless beyond few thousand users in the platform
      - Candidate did not consider pre-optimisation techniques for generating feed of the user
    High level architecture
      - Candidate was able to provide a basic functional high level architecture of the solution
      - Was able to discuss a brute force functional flow for post create and feed fetch API
    Low level cases
      - The number of queries for each feed creation was enourmous
      - Tracking of each user's already watched content was ng stored with hugh amount of space cost in terms of database tables
    Database schema design
      - Candidate was unable to mention all the relevant entities that should be considered in the schema design
      - Candidate did not provide much justification on using MySQL for primary storage for the feed data
      - Basic functional queries for the feedback generation was provided
