public class Indecisive {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(decision());
    }

    static boolean decision() {
        try {
            return true;
        } finally {
            return false;
        }
    }
}

public class Increment {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int j = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) j = j++;
        System.out.println(j);
    }
}

SingleThreadedExecutorService.
  -> Periodically (period=1sec) we are assigning tasks to the service (the thread)
  -> If the task execution/processing duration is larger than 1 second, that what happend to the tasks ?
  Eg :
t1 = 0 = 0.5s

t2 = 1 = 1.2s

t3 = 2 = 1.8s

t4 = 3 = 0.3s
Please mention the start time of execution of these tasks ?


Hibernate : what are dialects ?


Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.
LRUCache(int capacity)
int get(int key)
void put(int key, int value)
LRUCache lRUCache = new LRUCache(2);
lRUCache.put(1, 1); // cache is {1=1}
lRUCache.put(2, 2); // cache is {1=1, 2=2}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return 1
lRUCache.put(3, 3); // LRU key was 2, evicts key 2, cache is {1=1, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(2);    // returns -1 (not found)
lRUCache.put(4, 4); // LRU key was 1, evicts key 1, cache is {4=4, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return -1 (not found)
lRUCache.get(3);    // return 3
lRUCache.get(4);    // return 4
