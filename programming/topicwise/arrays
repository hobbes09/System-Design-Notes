  - Followup question :  How do you add intervals and merge them for a large stream of intervals? (Facebook Follow-up Question)
  - Inspired by https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/discuss/21452/Share-my-interval-tree-solution-no-sorting
  - Personal approach : Insertion sort on the array of intervals (Find the point where it can be inserted or merged) -- O(log(n)) order
