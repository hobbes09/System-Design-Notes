## Aggregation Service


## Batch Processing Service

Solutions :
  BinLog/CommitLog --> DMS --> Kafka --> Processing Service -> Data Sink
  Arch NFRs :
    - Sclability (Add more partitions, DMS instances, app scaling)
    - Ability to bifurcate the migration as much as possible
    - Reliability/Recoverability protocols
